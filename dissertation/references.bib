This is an example bib file, that flexes most of the capabilities of the .bst file.
The BibTeX entries in this file are intended to match the examples at:
https://libguides.nps.edu/citation/

If you do not reference a bibliographic entry in your thesis,
it will not be put into your references. Thus, you may keep these
example entries in your file for reference or you may delete everything
after the "START EXAMPLES" comment to start a fresh bib file.

General notes:
 - the last line in any entry should NOT have a comma following it
 - curly brackets are more robust than quotes for grouping text for individual entries, but you can use either
 - you don't need % for commenting, but it can be helpful as many editors will highlight the text as comments

Tip from a student:
When working on citations, I noticed the only way to reliably have edits in the citations/bibliography show up was to compile the LaTeX files, then build the bibliography with Bibtex, and finally compile the LaTeX files again.

% A helper command for identifying a page range in a document having page numbers like 1-10, 1-11, 1-12, etc.  Identify the page range as {1\hyphen1--1\hyphen10} for pages 1-1 through 1-10.
@preamble{{\providecommand*\hyphen{-}}}

% IEEE format only and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Department only:
% Cite this as the very first entry in your document, like right after "\begin{document}",
% with this special cite command:  \bstctlcite{forced-et-al-off}
@IEEEtranBSTCTL{forced-et-al-off,
    CTLuse_forced_etal = "no"
}

  year          = {2005}
}

Data Set / Database, published: NPS-customized use of misc class. Have "database" in journal field. Portability to other types maintained because journal field is ignored by misc type in most (if not all) other bib styles. Note braces around "Latinos" to preserve capitalization.
@misc{Suro:2004,

}

Database: NPS-customized use of misc class. Have "database" in journal field. Portability to other types maintained because journal field is ignored by misc type in most (if not all) other bib styles.  INFORMS will need the howpublished duplicated exactly to the key field.

  month         = {August 30,}
}

Dictionary or Encyclopedia: Use article class. Note that many dictionary and encyclopedia entries will warn that there is no author or, if online vice physical book, year.
- INFORMS needs the key field for sorting this author-less entry in the references list. Make sure it matches the title exactly.
- INFORMS needs the year field but IEEE should have no year field if dictionary/encyclopedia entry is not dated (which will throw warning but format correctly)
@article{merriam_2017,
    journal = {Merriam-Webster},
    year = {2017},
    note = {Accessed July 6, 2017},
    title = {Metamorphosis},
    key = {Metamorphosis},
    url = {https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metamorphosis}}

Fact Sheet: Use manual class.  If the fact sheet has a serial number, you can include that in the `howpublished` field.

  year      = {2008},
  url       = {http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs1.htm}
}

}

Joint Doctrine: Use manual class. Note backslashes before underscores in URL, to prevent format corruption.
@manual{JP-3-01,
  title         = {Countering Air and Missile Threats},

}

Government/Military (Field Manual or Military Regulation): Follow the manual style. Notice how the % signs in the URL need a \ preceeding them.  With no author, the key field is necessary for sorting in the INFORMS reference list. Make sure it matches the organization exactly.
@manual{sniper_2011,
  title         = "Sniper Training",
  howpublished  = "FM 23-10",

}

Handbook (online): Use manual class.
- NPS customizes this type by using the journal field to indicate that this manual is a handbook. Portability to other types maintained because journal field is ignored by manual type in most (if not all) other bib styles.
- For INFORMS only:  Use key for author-less entry to enable reference list sorting. Make sure it matches the organization exactly.
@manual{TSP-168:1972,

    url = {https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1700/RR1776/RAND_RR1776.pdf},
    year = {2017}}

Report, Technical Report: Use techreport class. Use BRACES to retain capitalization of proper noun and acronyms in title.  To change the type of report from your style's default, use the `type` field.
@techreport{Wonka:1972,
    author        = {Wonka, W and Loompa, O and Bucket, C},
    title         = {Stochastic error-correction in a hyperbaric ethereal pulley system for vitreous personal vertical displacement apparatuses {(PVDA)}},
    number        = {VK-1916},
    institution   = {Gloop Corporation},
    address       = {Great Missenden, UK},
    year          = {1876},
    url           = {https://www.beanfeast.org/badegg/wahwah.pdf}
}

Secondary Source: Use class of appropriate source type. In this case, it's a book. Note format of author name in Author field to express his three first initials.
@book{Nicholson:2003,
     author     = {Nicholson, Ian A M},
     title      = {Inventing Personality: Gordon Allport and the Science of Selfhood},
     year       = {2003},
     publisher  = {American Psychological Association},
     address    = {Washington, DC}
}

Standard: Standards fit well with manual class.
@manual{standard_1968,
  title         = "Letter Symbols for Quantities",
  howpublished  = "ANSI Standard Y10.5",
  key           = "ANSI",
  year          = "1968",
  url           = "https://standards.globalspec.com/std/1713423/asme-ansi-y10-5"
}

Thesis, from commercial database. Use mastersthesis class. Note double braces in note field to force capitalization of "ProQuest."
- For IEEE:  Type field is optional if "M.S. thesis"; otherwise, enter the appropriate degree, Master of Arts ("M.A. thesis") this case.
@mastersthesis{Nekeip:2008,
     author     = {Nekeip, Ray},
     title      = {Pescatarians and daisies: A match made in sushi heaven},
     school     = {Garden of Sushi School of Sushi},
     address    = {Maui, HI},
     year       = {2008},
     note       = {{P}roQuest Dissertations and Theses database (AAT 3300426)}
}

Dissertation, from  institutional archive such as the NPS archive Calhoun: Use phdthesis class. Enter department in School field.
@phdthesis{Yoshi:1988,
     author     = {Yoshi, Helen},
     title      = {Effects of pizza consumption on katana-wielding dexterity in terrapinoids},
     school     = {Department of Reptile Bellicosity, Eastman \& Laird University},
     address    = {New York, NY},
     year       = {1988},
     url        = {https://hdl.handle.net/6576565753/splinter.html}
}

Unpublished Work Accepted for Publication: BECAUSE this is a journal article, the journal class was a better choice than the unpublished class. ENTER word "Forthcoming" in Note field.
A separate note:  When an author's name has a suffix (e.g., Jr., Sr., III), you need to list the name parts, separated by commas:  Last, Suffix, First M
@article{Horse:1996,
      author       = {Horse, Sr., Bob Brewster},
      title        = {Back in the saddle 2: Back in the saddle},
      journal      = {Gaucho Marx: A Journal of Cowpoke Consciousness},
      year         = {1996},
      note         = {Forthcoming},
      url          = {http://blahblahblahhorse.com/bits2bits}
}

Unpublished Work (print): Use unpublished class.
@unpublished{Horse:1995,
       author     = {Horse, Bob Brewster},
       title      = {Back in the saddle},
       year       = {1995},
       note       = {unpublished memoir, Leaping H Ranch, Peoria, IL}
}

Unpublished Work (arXiv): Use unpublished class.
@unpublished{simonyan-vgg16-2015,
  title={Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition},
  author={Simonyan, K. and Zisserman, A.},
  note={{arXiv}},
  year={2014},
  doi={10.48550/arXiv.1409.1556}
}

Webpage, author and publication date given: Use misc class. Provide access date only if no publication date is available and the info is likely to change, as in dynamic content, or the link is now broken.
@misc{Sushi:1995,
      author       = {Sushi, Ursella Quest},
      year         = {1995},
      title        = {Absorption of cats in sushi},
      howpublished = {Sushi Lab},
      note         = {Accessed November 9, 1999},
      url          = {http://www.wallcrust.com/hgtehrwOIASD.html}
}

Website (Organization as Author): Use misc class. Use double brackets around organization as author to avoid "F. B. of Investigation" as the author.
@misc{FBI_2017,
  author        = {{Federal Bureau of Investigation}},
  title         = {Forging papers to sell fake art},
  month         = "Apr. 6,", 
  year          = "2017",
  url           = "https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/forging-papers-to-sell-fake-art"
}

Webpage, No date given. See notes in above entry, entering YEAR ACCESSED in Year field for INFORMS; IEEE does not require year field for undated material.
@misc{Python:2017,
      author     = {Python, Mary},
      year       = {2017},
      title      = {Finding a dead parrot on a silly walk},
      howpublished = {Ministry of Silly Walks},
      note       = {Accessed August 6, 2017},
      url        = {https://www.omgitsadeadparrot.com/feathers}
}

Website (Jane's Example): Use misc class.  Because there is no author, INFORMS needs the key field to match the howpublished field exactly.
@misc{Janes_2017,
    howpublished = {Jane's},
    key = {Jane's},
    month = {May 31,},
    title = {Mali: Executive summary},
    url = {https://customer.janes.com/},
    year = {2017}}

Wikipedia: Just like Dictionary or Encyclopedia above. Use article class. Note that many dictionary and encyclopedia entries will in IEEE warn that there is no author or year.  INFORMS reqires a year for all entries and a key (matching the title field exactly) for author-less entries.
@article{wiki_2016,
    journal = {Wikipedia},
    note = {Accessed May 17, 2016},
    year = {2016},
    title = {Psychology},
    key = {Psychology},
    url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology}}

Working paper/occassional paper: Misc works well. Note the need to escape (put backslash \ before) % sign, like \%, in URL.
@misc{sushi_2021,
    address = {Pierre, SD, USA},
    author = {U. Q. Sushi},
    howpublished = {working paper},
    organization = {Donburi Inst. of Int. Gastron.},
    title = {Three-handed {F}ibonacci model for optimizing surface-to-volume ratio of temaki in {H}ilbert space},
    url = {https://www.wallcrust.com/403t3-9j/340txf\%oii\%/gonzoponzu.html},
    year = {2021}}

Ref only in exec sum
@unpublished{Unicorn:1995,
       author     = {Unicorn, Bob Brewster},
       title      = {In the saddle},
       year       = {1995},
       note       = {Unpublished memoir, Leaping H Ranch, Peoria, IL}
}
