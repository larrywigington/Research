\documentclass[thesis,ieee,twoside]{npsreport2018}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \documentclass Options
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Welcome to the NPS thesis template!  The "\documentclass" command above is
% where you tell LaTeX what type of document you would like to make.  We describe
% the options to you here.
%
% First note that the command has two parts, the options in square brackets [] and
% the name of the class, "npsreport2018", in the curly braces {}.
%
% thesis, dissertation, article, techreport:  The thesis, dissertation, and techreport
%     options enable multiple chapters and extend the LaTeX report class.  The article
%     option has no chapters (it is all one chapter) and extends the LaTeX article class.
% ieee or informs:  Select one of these options to set the citation style
% twoside:  Use this option for theses and disserations.  It forces all chapters to start
%     on odd-numbered pages (the right-hand side of a book) instead of the next page.
%     Omitting this option is recommended for other types.
% twoauthors, threeauthors, fourauthors:  The default is to have only one author so add
%     one of these options for specifying a number of authors greater than one
% acronym:  This option limits the acronyms printed in the acronym list (if you print one
%     at all) to those that you used in your document by activating the "printonlyused"
%     option of the acronym package.  Without this option, when you print the list of
%     acronyms, it will include all those defined, regardless of whether they are used
%     in the document.
%
% Advisors and Readers for thesis type:
%   twoadvisors:  two advisors but no second reader
%   twoadvisorsreader:  two advisors AND also a second reader
%   tworeaders:  two second readers
%
% Dissertation Committee Members for dissertation type:
%   fivemembers:  default committee size is six
%   advisoralone:  lists the top person alone
%
% Less Commonly Used Options:
%   classified:  use if you are in the STBL or SCIF writing classified work
%   singlespace:  as opposed to the standard spacing for a thesis
%   compacttitle
%   10pt, 11pt, 12pt:  sets font size, thesis requirement is 12pt
%   times, arial, courier:  sets the font face, thesis requirement is times
%

% Packages
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% LaTeX's extensibility comes through users' ability to use "packages."
% Here are some packages specifically here for use in this template.  Feel free to delete
% or comment out the first two of these:
\usepackage{hologo,lipsum} % provides \BibTex and \lipsum macros, for demos; can delete this package (just filler text)
\newcommand{\BibTeX}{\hologo{BibTeX}} %provides \BibTeX macro for demos; can delete this command
\ifnpstechreport
\else
\usepackage[fontsize=20pt,text=To~be~replaced~by~your~thesis~processor~using~the~data~from~your~Python~Thesis~Dashboard,color=red]{draftwatermark}
\fi

% For Example: you might find one of these useful:
\usepackage[defaultlines=2,all]{nowidow}    % automatic management of widows and orphans
\usepackage{listings}        % Use this for showing blocks of computer code
\usepackage{longtable}       % Use this for tables that are longer than one page
\usepackage{pdflscape}       % provides landscape environment
% \usepackage{stocksize}       % provides the ability to change the size of the paper  %%% Requires TeXLive 2025 or later!
%\usepackage{bibunits}        % Use this if you need to put references in your Executive Summary
%\usepackage{colortbl}        % provides commands to color table columns, rows, cells, etc.
%\usepackage{epstopdf}        % to use .eps files for figures
%\usepackage{bm}              % bold math if you need bold greek letters
%\usepackage{glossaries}      % comment out {doc,lipsum} package to use this package; see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
%\usepackage{asymptote}       % for graphics
% The asymptote package allows for very nice graphics and figures
% Proper usage requires additional information located at:
% http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/
% See the gallery at this URL for examples

%\usepackage{placeins}        % float placement
% Provides \FloatBarrier which keeps figures/tables in the same section.
% LaTeX sometimes moves them to fill up pages.
% http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/placeins/placeins-doc.pdf

%\usepackage[numbered]{mcode} % matlab code
% The mcode package must be separately downloaded.
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8015-m-code-latex-package

%\usepackage{flafter}         % float placement
% Ensures that figures/tables do not appear in the document before
% they are referenced in the text.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Information about your work
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input{frontmatter/front-matter}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Here's where you put the actual content for the body of your thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% CHAPTERS
% You have two options on how to structure your thesis:
% a) A single file. All chapters, sections, etc. go in this file.
%    This can make navigating your thesis a little more difficult.
% b) Use multiple files.  One chapter per file is recommended.
%    This breaks your thesis up into logical units to edit.
%
\input{chapters/01_introduction}


% APPENDICES
% Appendices are not mandatory thesis components. You should use them if you need them.
% You have three options:
% 1) No appendix. Comment-out the lines in this section.
%
% 2) A single appendix (with a single TOC entry). Use these lines, adapted to your needs:
\NPSappendixTOC{[My Appendix Title]}
\input{appendices/appendix_1}
%
% 3) Multiple appendices. Use this line:
%\NPSappendices
%    ...followed by this set of two lines for each appendix:
% \chapter{[First appendix title]}
% \input{appendix_1}
% \chapter{[Second appendix title]}
% \input{appendix_1}


% SUPPLEMENTALS
% If you want to include a supplemental with your thesis, Follow the instructions at https://nps.edu/web/thesisprocessing/supplementals.
% The file linked in the following line shows an example.
% \input{additional_resources/supplementals.tex}


% REFERENCES
% List all your BibTeX reference source files (ending in *.bib extension)

% This command builds the bibliography:
% 1. The default thesis style is nps-ieee.bst for IEEE and nps-informs.bst for INFORMS
% 2. The argument "references" tells LaTeX to find your bib items in the file references.bib
\NPSbibliography{references}

% Notes:
% 1. You can include multiple bib files (just comma separate them), for example:  \NPSbibliography{references,other-refs}
% 2. Ensure the formatting matches the library's guidance (https://libguides.nps.edu/citation/bibtex).
% 3. If not using a bib style (.bst) offered in the template, you can specify it like this:  \NPSbibliography[chicago]{references}
