This is an example of how to create an executive summary with its own references 
section using the \texttt{bibunit} package.
The build process needs to change to accomodate this. 
The \texttt{bibunit} package builds separate unit files
\texttt{bu1.aux}, \texttt{bu2.aux}, etc. 
These needs to be run through \BibTeX{} separately.
In this example, the executive summary is the first (and only) bibunit, 
so we need to do the commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \texttt{pdflatex report}
	\item[] \texttt{bibtex report}
	\item[] \texttt{bibtex bu1}
	\item[] \texttt{pdflatex report}
	\item[] \texttt{pdflatex report}
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{Makefile} demonstrates how to script this.

\section*{Executive Summary Section} % Use the stared section/subsection/etc. commands here so they do not create TOC entries
The references~\citet{americans_1991,haynes_2009}
are in both the executive summary
and in the main thesis; they are numbered separately.
Some references~\citep{Unicorn:1995} appear only in the executive summary,
and are not part of the final List of References of the thesis.

Note, you cannot use numbered sections in the executive summary,
since the summary has no number itself.

This sentence demonstrates that acronyms, like \ac{US} and \ac{TCP}, work in the
executive summary; the \ac{US} is the short version. The counter will be re-set
in the main body, where its first use will be long again.
