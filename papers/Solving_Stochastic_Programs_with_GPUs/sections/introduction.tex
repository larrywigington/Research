\section{Introduction}
Stochastic programming provides a framework for decision-making under uncertainty. However, solving large-scale stochastic programs—particularly with thousands of scenarios—poses severe computational challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging GPU acceleration to address this bottleneck, comparing native GPU implementations of first-order optimization methods.
