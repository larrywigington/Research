% Put (optional) Executive Summary here.
% New paragraphs start after an empty line. See exec_sum_with_refs.tex under the examples directory for a demo.
% If not using, comment-out or delete all of these lines.
%
\NPSexecsummary{%
This is different from your abstract. An executive summary is required or recommended for the departments listed \href{https://nps.edu/documents/105790666/106471207/Executive_Summary_Guidance.pdf}{\underline{here}}. Most executive summaries range from 2--5 pages.

An executive summary is a highly condensed version of your thesis that should be able to stand alone, independent of your thesis. An executive summary should summarize your purpose, methods, results, conclusions, and recommendations to allow someone who can read ONLY that document to walk away with a solid understanding of the research.

If you include figures or tables in your executive summary, do not use the caption commands for the titles. Instead, manually type in the titles. This will keep these titles out of your thesis's Lists of Figures and List of Tables, and allow the figure and table numbering to start at “1” in the thesis body, as required.

% How to have References in your Executive Summary:
If you include citations in the Executive Summary, it may make more sense to type your entries in manually, since most executive summaries contain only a handful of sources. To add a reference list programmatically, see exec\_sum\_with\_refs.tex in the ``additional\_resources'' node of this template for the code.
% Instead of having this sample Executive Summary content here, put your executive summary in the
% file additional_resources/exec_sum_with_refs.tex and use this next line to link it here:
%\input{additional_resources/exec_sum_with_refs}
}

%
% Put (optional) acknowledgements here.  
% New paragraphs start after an empty line.
% If not using, comment-out or delete all of these lines.
%
\NPSacknowledgements{%
Optional for all departments. Acknowledgments may be more informal in tone than the main thesis text but should still follow the correct use of sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation. 

Write your own acknowledgments; do not borrow the text from another author. While acknowledgments tend to be similar across document types, they should reflect your own language and sentence structure.
