\section{Background}
We review the two-stage and multistage stochastic programming formulations, emphasizing the extensive form structure. Existing CPU-based solvers are reviewed, followed by an overview of first-order optimization methods such as SCS, ADMM, and PDHG, and their existing GPU implementations.
